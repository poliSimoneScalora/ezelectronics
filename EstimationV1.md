# Project Estimation - CURRENT

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZElectronics  project in CURRENT version (as given by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 3 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 650 | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)    | 1950 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 195 |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 5850 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 6 days|               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document    | 39 |
| GUI prototype | 10 |
|design document | 29 |
|code | 58,5 |
| unit tests | 19,5 |
| api tests | 19,5 |
| management documents | 19,5 |



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |195| 6 days 
| estimate by product decomposition |195| 6 days
| estimate by activity decomposition |576 | 24 days (18 working)

In questa versione, essendo il progetto più semplice, una stima basata principalmente sulla dimensione potrebbe essere più accurata.
